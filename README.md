# Express.js Route Parameter Handling Error: Missing Input Validation

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route parameter handling: failure to validate input before using it in database queries or other operations.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, which directly uses the `req.params.id` without any validation. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the code that adds input validation and robust error handling, significantly improving the code's safety and reliability.
